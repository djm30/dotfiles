# Dotfiles

All my dotfiles, each application is stored in its own folder, with a `links.prop` to configure any symlinks required

### Installation
Run this command to clone the repo and setup symlinks

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djm30/dotfiles/main/install/setup.sh | bash
```
#### Other install scripts
- install.sh - installs fonts, applications and cli tools
- macos_config.sh - configures MacOS with some options I like


## Todo
